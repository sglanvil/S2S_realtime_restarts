I pulled the GDAS and CDAS files for NCEP CFSv2 data from the RDA (NCAR) 
data archive. These are 6-hourly data products located at:
/glade/collections/rda/data/ds093.0 (most GDAS 1979-2010)
and /glade/collections/rda/data/ds094.0 (first 3 months of 2011 are GDAS, 
rest of 2011 - present are CDAS)

The scripts untar_raw_CFSv2data_gdas.ncl and untar_raw_CFSv2data.ncl untar all 
needed files through the timeseries and grab only the valid times needed for 
the CLM DATM stream files. The files are placed in:
/glade/collections/nmme/ncgd0022/jcaron/CFSv2/data_files

The script create_landforcing_from_NCEPCFSv4.ncl processes these files into 
netCDF DATM Stream files for CLM and puts them in:
/glade/collections/nmme/ncgd0022/jcaron/CFSv2/forcing_files

Then, I've produced a land domain file that CLM requires for a new dataset to 
be used. The script obtain_0.2d_mask_dims.ncl pulls information from a data 
file and creates a mask used by Sean Swenson's create_domain_hr.pro script. 

Running Sean's script produces the actual domain file used by CLM, and I put 
this in the forcing_files directory with all the other DATM stream data.
(run idl, compile the script, and then run it using create_domain)

Now, We move to spinning up the land with these data. But since these data are 
new, there are not definied DATM compsets in CLM for them. So we will create a 
new case with an existing compset and modify the data paths to meet our needs.
(This is where it would be much better to just have a new land compset get 
created for us.)

To do this, we move to /glade/collections/nmme/ncgd0022/jcaron/code_landIC.
Here we run the spin up of the land first with our NCEP CFSv2.

In Jerry O's script called i.e13.ICFSCN.f09_f09.01_build.csh
Modify path of model to create case from, casename for land spinup case, 
resolution, account/projnum, location for bld & run, and configuration 
desired (CLM_CONFIG_OPTS), as well as number of years to spin up over (in 
our case not too many so that we are not including trends), and the DATM_MODE 
which points to the data for an existing land datm compset. (the length of the
spinup will depend a lot on whether it is an SP case or one with CN turned on).

To check if the case is spunup, use Keith's scripts:
in /glade/collections/nmme/ncgd0022/jcaron/new_nmme_runs/land_model/
for SP run: SpinupStability_SP_v8.ncl
for CN run: SpinupStability_v9.ncl
being sure to change paths to your data and casename.
 
Once it is spunup, use Jerry O's script:
/glade/collections/nmme/ncgd0022/jcaron/code_landIC/i.e13.ICRUCN.ne30_ne30.1979-2018.001_build.csh
to create a case to run the land model to create restarts across the full 
range of forcing data. You need to change casename, resolution and all the 
other usual changes for your specific case.


special note/caveat:
when extending the data, the land model wants a full month of data, so the 
remaining days in the month if any, are currently set to missing. Also, the 
model will not run past what you've specified in the case checkout without 
updating the year, mo info by adding files to the user_datm stream files,
as well as the data in the user_nl_datm file which is set to whatever year 
you specified to be your last year when setting up your land case. THIS IS 
IMPORTANT, because the land will wrap back around to the beginning of the 
stream data (1979) otherwise.

AND you need to move or tar up or delete the *.rs1*.bin file from the run 
directory. This apparently hangs onto information from the original create case.


The newer, real-time NCEP CFSv2 data is at the rda site specified in the 
untar script:
/glade/collections/rda/data/ds094.0/<yyyy>/

and can also be obtained from:

http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/cfs/prod/cdas.<yyyymmdd>/cdas1.t*z.sfluxgrbf06.grib2
where yyyymmdd is the year month and day for approximately the last 5 days.
